1. master flat saved as masterflat.fits

2. Bright/dark regions only visible on small scales
     (used "histogram equalization" as scale)

   Dark region surf_bri   = 14981.405
   Bright region surf_bri = 14991.371
   fraction of light on dark = 0.999

   Maybe because we took flats at -5degC instead of -10degC used for bias

3. One dead pixel

4. Take various regions with incr. distance from center,
   Record position and brightness
   

5. "darker" side is now on opposite side,
    cannot re-take flats unless you remember the camera orientation
